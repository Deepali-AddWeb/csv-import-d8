1. ABOUT
========

This module allows a user to apply any Image Styles to transform any image which will be uploaded into the system
(doesn't depend on which field or entity type will be used).
It can improve UX because you can just transform uploaded image according to your rules,
instead of displaying error messages like "file is too big" or "PNG files are not allowed".

The user can activate several Image Styles to use them for a transformation of images.
Also, a separate set of Image Styles can be specified for each file extension.
For example, you can activate Image Styles to convert each PNG file to JPG and scale it to 1000x1000.
